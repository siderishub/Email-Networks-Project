# Email-Networks-Project

This was a project assigned to me in my undergrad CS class about networking. The assignment was to implement an email server with users having access to their emails. So essentially when the server program is open, it listens for incoming requests from a client program. When a request is made, it creates a separate server thread to serve that client. The program was implemented so that multiple people could connect to their account at the same time from different clients.
